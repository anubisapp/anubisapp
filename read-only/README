APACHE CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE:
First of all, set up SSL to cover your authentication.  USING HTTP FOR HTTP
AUTHENTICATION IS NOT SECURE - PASSWORDS ARE SENT IN THE CLEAR.
        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all

                AuthUserFile /some/path/outside/served/directories/users
                AuthName "Area protected by belligerent drunk."
                AuthGroupFile /dev/null
                AuthType Basic
                Require valid-user
        </Directory>

        <LocationMatch "/AnubisApp/(read-only|images|css|table-images)">
                Satisfy Any
                Allow from all
        </LocationMatch>

This makes it so your entire website (except for the matched locations) is password protected.  It's nice to have that as a blanket policy.

MYSQL CONFIGURATION:
In addition to the normal SQL stuff you have to do with AnubisApp, you have to do
the following (change the database name / user / password as needed):

mysql> CREATE USER 'anubis-read-only'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'foobar';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

mysql> GRANT SELECT ON anubis.* TO 'anubis-read-only'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)
